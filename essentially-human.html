                    As artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly performs tasks once thought uniquely human—complex 
                    reasoning, composition, even what appears as creativity—many feel a reasonable anxiety. If machines 
                    can think and create, what's special about being human? If a machine can fill that role in the world, 
                    where do humans belong?

                <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    This anxiety springs from an error obscured by roughly 200 years of post-Enlightenment

                    Put simply, today we primarily view people as things, whereas we once viewed people as 
                    thing/divinity composites. Matter from below joins with form above to create humans who exist where 
                    the two meet. Through the scientific materialist lens, we only see the matter from below.

                    Whether as—<em>clears throat</em>—objective observers of material phenomena, units of economic output, 
                    loci of credit and debt, economic classes, operators of institutions and businesses, pedigrees of 
                    education and institutional status, vocational and technical skillsets, sophisticated apes, conscious 
                    meat-suits, emotion reservoirs, smart-device users, consumers of all things—modern people have developed 
                    every vector for slicing, construing, measuring, and computing human beings except the one that comports 
                    with reality. If, in reality, we are thing/divinity composites, then each of these clever parameters 
                    captures only a fragment of a much greater whole. And as long as we understand ourselves this way, we 
                    drift further toward sadness or mania—both of which are abundant today.

                    From classical Greek philosophy onward, major interlocutors in the history of thought have offered 
                    serious answers to the question of human being. I'll mention two here, though others are worth seeking 
                    out if interested. Aristotle did not define human being by its computational power or productivity, 
                    but as a sustained activity of the soul in accordance with the good. Both "the good" and "the soul" 
                    are central concepts in philosophy and human life. I recommend reading about them. Try the

                    for the good, and

                    for the soul.

                    Nietzsche diagnosed the danger that emerges when this orientation is lost. In the absence of a clear 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telos" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-red-600 font-bold underline hover:text-red-700"><em>telos</em></a>, 
                    human beings grasp at substitutes: power, pleasure, status, moral self-righteousness, 
                    productivity etc. Today, cognitive superiority has joined the list. In an industrial, technical, machine 
                    economy, the cleverest is the best. He who autists the hardest for the machines is paid and valued the 
                    most. Yet none of these constitute the essence of human being. They are instrumental goods at best, 
                    empty distractions at worst.

                    Stripped to its essence, human being is characterized by spending the limited time and energy of one's 
                    body and mind making moral choices toward the good, the true, and the beautiful—and then suffering the 
                    consequences. This moral drama, not intelligence, productivity, or creativity as such, defines human life.

                <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Suffering, therefore, is not incidental. It is structurally necessary. The Greeks understood that 
                    character (<em>ēthos</em>) is formed through repeated choices under conditions of resistance. A close 
                    plesionym might be the modern concept of 
                    <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118924396.wbiea2142" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-red-600 font-bold underline hover:text-red-700">identity</a>. 
                    The more character is forged through suffering, 
                    the more one becomes <em>somebody</em>.

                    Christianity builds on the Greeks' natural philosophy. For Roman Catholics, suffering united to Christ 
                    brings the peace and joy of the Holy Spirit, participates in Jesus' redemptive work, and purifies the 
                    soul in preparation for the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatific_vision" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-red-600 font-bold underline hover:text-red-700">beatific vision</a>. 
                    In Orthodox theology, suffering purifies, loosens the grip 
                    of the passions, and prepares the human person for 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosis_(Eastern_Christian_theology)" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-red-600 font-bold underline hover:text-red-700">theosis</a>—participation 
                    in divine life. In both 
                    traditions, suffering is not merely endured; it is integral to the process of becoming good and 
                    essential to union with God.

                    to the Greek and Christian understanding of suffering as formative rather than 
                    accidental, human identity is revealed as something forged through choice, love, and sacrifice. What 
                    matters most is not what one can do better than others, but what one is willing to endure for love of 
                    the true, the good, and the beautiful.

                    One is fortunate to live in a time whose circumstances forcefully thrust the question of human being 
                    into view. The arrival of thinking machines does not threaten the meaning of human life; it exposes 
                    how long it has been misunderstood. The question, "What am I for, if a machine can do what I do 
                    better?", warmly beckons human reflection back to the beginning. As long as we can remember what we 
                    are—and are willing to bear the cost of acting accordingly—there is nothing to fear.
